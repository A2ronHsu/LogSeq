## [What are web forms?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form#what_are_web_forms)
* **Web forms** are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application.
* Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage
* A web form's HTML is made up of one or more **form controls** (sometimes called **widgets**), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form — they are often referred to as **HTML forms**.
* The controls can be single or multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, and are mostly created using the [[<input>]] element
* Form controls can also be programmed to enforce specific formats or values to be entered (**[[form validation]]**), and paired with text labels that describe their purpose to both sighted and visually impaired users.
