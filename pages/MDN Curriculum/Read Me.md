This is a the MDN curriculum continuation from what i was doing in Freeplane mindmap. Here i am going to start with the section [2.7 Other interactive elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/semantic-html/#2.7_other_interactive_elements) of the [2 Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/semantic-html/), which talk about forms. Next to this i'm going to continue the [3 CSS fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/css-fundamentals/) [3.9 Styling form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/css-fundamentals/#3.9_styling_form_elements).`
